Balanced calibrations
#####################

The default calibration method for M3 is what is called "balanced" calibration.  Balanced calibrations
sample all independent and pair-wise readout error rates evenly; hence the name "balanced".  In M3 v3
and higher, this routine has been updated to use a method from Bravyi et al, Phys. Rev. A 103, 042605 (2021).

To see the bit-patterns used to generate the calibration circuits one can call the generator explicitly.  E.g. to
see the strings for 5-qubits one would do 

.. jupyter-execute::

    import mthree

    gen = mthree.generators.HadamardGenerator(5)
    list(gen)


For every position in the bit-string you will see that `0` or `1` appear an equal number of times,
and the same is true for all pair-wise combinations of `0` and `1`.
If there is a `0`, then that circuit samples the :math:`|0\rangle` state for that qubit,
similarly for the `1` element.  So when we execute the balanced calibration circuits
using `shots` number of samples, each error rate in the calibration data is actually
being sampled more times than requested.  Thus, when you pass the `shots` value to M3, in the balanced
calibration mode internally it divides by the number of measured qubits so that the precision of each
error rate matches the precison of the other methods.  That is to say that the following:

 .. jupyter-execute::

    from qiskit_ibm_runtime.fake_provider import FakeAthensV2
    
    backend = FakeAthensV2()
    mit = mthree.M3Mitigation(backend)
    mit.cals_from_system(method='balanced')

Will sample each indepdendent qubit error rate `10000` times (or the max allowed by the target system if less) 
regardless of which method is used. All pair-wise correlations are measured half this number of times. This
yields a calibration process whose  overhead is independent of the number of qubits used; there is no additional
cost to compute the calibration over a full device.  Note that, when using a simulator or "fake" device, 
M3 defaults to `independent` calibration mode for efficiency.  As such, to enable `balanced` calibration on a 
simulator one must explicitly set the `method`` as done above.
